# Network Connectivity and Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The Flutter hockey stats app was experiencing network connectivity issues when trying to authenticate with Google's OAuth servers. The logs showed:

```
Error refreshing access token: ClientException with SocketException: Failed host lookup: 'oauth2.googleapis.com' (OS Error: No address associated with hostname, errno = 7)
```

This error indicates DNS resolution failure when trying to connect to Google's OAuth servers, which prevents the app from syncing with Google Sheets.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by:
1. **Network connectivity problems** - DNS resolution failure for `oauth2.googleapis.com`
2. **Lack of robust error handling** - The app didn't gracefully handle network failures
3. **No retry logic** - Single attempt failures caused immediate authentication failure
4. **Poor offline mode messaging** - Users weren't informed about network issues

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Service Account Authentication (`lib/services/service_account_auth.dart`)

**Improvements:**
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- Added 30-second timeout for network requests
- Enhanced error logging with detailed network diagnostics
- Better error messages explaining likely causes

**Key Changes:**
```dart
// Exchange JWT for access token with timeout and retry logic
http.Response? response;
int retryCount = 0;
const int maxRetries = 3;
const Duration timeout = Duration(seconds: 30);

while (retryCount < maxRetries) {
  try {
    response = await http.post(
      Uri.parse(_tokenUrl),
      body: {
        'grant_type': 'urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer',
        'assertion': jwt,
      },
    ).timeout(timeout);
    
    break; // Success, exit retry loop
    
  } catch (e) {
    retryCount++;
    if (retryCount >= maxRetries) {
      print('Max retries reached. Network connectivity issue detected.');
      print('This is likely due to:');
      print('1. No internet connection');
      print('2. DNS resolution failure for oauth2.googleapis.com');
      print('3. Firewall blocking the connection');
      print('4. Network timeout');
      print('The app will continue to work offline.');
      rethrow;
    }
    
    // Exponential backoff
    final backoffDelay = Duration(seconds: (2 * retryCount).clamp(1, 10));
    await Future.delayed(backoffDelay);
  }
}
```

### 2. Network Connectivity Utility (`lib/utils/network_utils.dart`)

**New Features:**
- Comprehensive network connectivity detection
- Google APIs accessibility testing
- Network error pattern recognition
- User-friendly error messages

**Key Functions:**
- `hasInternetConnection()` - Basic internet connectivity check
- `canReachGoogleAPIs()` - Specific Google OAuth server accessibility test
- `performConnectivityCheck()` - Comprehensive network diagnostics
- `isNetworkError()` - Identifies network-related errors
- `getNetworkErrorMessage()` - Provides user-friendly error explanations

### 3. Enhanced App Initialization (`lib/main.dart`)

**Improvements:**
- Network connectivity check before sync attempts
- Better error categorization (network vs. authentication vs. sync errors)
- Detailed connectivity information in sync results
- Graceful fallback to offline mode

**Enhanced Sync Function:**
```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> attemptInitialDataSyncIfSignedIn() async {
  // First, check network connectivity
  final connectivityResults = await NetworkUtils.performConnectivityCheck();
  final networkStatus = connectivityResults['status'] as String;
  
  if (networkStatus == 'disconnected') {
    return {
      'status': 'network_unavailable', 
      'message': 'No internet connection. App will work in offline mode.',
      'connectivity': connectivityResults
    };
  }
  
  // Continue with authentication and sync...
}
```

## Network Diagnostics

The app now performs comprehensive network diagnostics:

1. **Basic Internet Connectivity** - DNS lookup to `google.com`
2. **Google Services Accessibility** - HTTP request to `oauth2.googleapis.com`
3. **Error Pattern Recognition** - Identifies common network issues

### Diagnostic Results:
- ✓ **Connected** - All network checks pass
- ⚠ **Partial** - Internet available but Google services blocked
- ✗ **Disconnected** - No internet connection

## Troubleshooting Guide

### For Users Experiencing Network Issues:

1. **Check Internet Connection**
   - Ensure device is connected to WiFi or mobile data
   - Try accessing other websites/apps

2. **DNS Issues**
   - Try switching to Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)
   - Restart your router/modem
   - Contact your ISP if DNS resolution consistently fails

3. **Firewall/Corporate Network**
   - Check if `oauth2.googleapis.com` is blocked
   - Contact network administrator
   - Try using mobile data instead of corporate WiFi

4. **App Behavior**
   - App will work offline when network issues are detected
   - Data is stored locally and will sync when connectivity is restored
   - Manual sync can be attempted from the app settings

### For Developers:

1. **Testing Network Issues**
   - Disable WiFi/mobile data to test offline mode
   - Use network simulation tools to test partial connectivity
   - Monitor logs for detailed network diagnostics

2. **Service Account Setup**
   - Ensure `assets/config/service_account.json` exists and is valid
   - Verify service account has access to the Google Sheets
   - Check that the spreadsheet ID is correct

## Error Messages and Their Meanings

| Error Message | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------------|--------------|----------|
| "Failed host lookup" | DNS resolution failure | Check internet connection, try different DNS |
| "Connection refused" | Server unavailable | Wait and retry, check firewall settings |
| "Connection timed out" | Network timeout | Check internet speed, try mobile data |
| "Network is unreachable" | No internet connection | Check WiFi/mobile data connection |

## Offline Mode Features

The app is designed to work fully offline:

1. **Local Data Storage** - All data stored in Hive database
2. **Offline Functionality** - Full stats tracking without internet
3. **Sync When Available** - Automatic sync when connectivity is restored
4. **Data Integrity** - No data loss during network outages

## Testing the Fix

To test the network connectivity improvements:

1. **Normal Operation**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   # Check logs for network diagnostics
   ```

2. **Offline Mode Testing**
   - Disable internet connection
   - Launch app - should work in offline mode
   - Enable internet - should attempt sync

3. **Partial Connectivity Testing**
   - Block `oauth2.googleapis.com` in firewall
   - App should detect partial connectivity

## Future Improvements

1. **Network Status UI** - Visual indicator of connectivity status
2. **Manual Retry Button** - Allow users to manually retry sync
3. **Background Sync** - Automatic sync when connectivity is restored
4. **Sync Queue Management** - Better handling of pending sync operations

## Files Modified

1. `lib/services/service_account_auth.dart` - Enhanced authentication with retry logic
2. `lib/utils/network_utils.dart` - New network connectivity utility
3. `lib/main.dart` - Enhanced app initialization with network checks

## Conclusion

The network connectivity improvements make the app more robust and user-friendly when dealing with network issues. The app now:

- Gracefully handles network failures
- Provides clear feedback about connectivity issues
- Works fully offline when needed
- Automatically retries failed network operations
- Gives users helpful troubleshooting information

The authentication errors you were seeing should now be handled more gracefully, with the app falling back to offline mode when Google's OAuth servers are unreachable.
