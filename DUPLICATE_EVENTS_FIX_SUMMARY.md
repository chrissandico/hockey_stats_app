# Duplicate Events Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

The hockey stats app was creating duplicate events in Google Sheets for game id = 48 (and potentially other games). Analysis revealed that:

1. **Same events with identical IDs** were being synced multiple times
2. **Identical timestamps** for all duplicates
3. **Both goals and shots** were affected
4. **Root cause**: The `syncGameEvent` method always appended new rows without checking for existing events

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. No Deduplication Logic
- The `syncGameEvent` method always used `append` operation
- No check for existing events with the same ID
- Multiple sync triggers could sync the same event repeatedly

### 2. Multiple Sync Triggers
- Background sync every 5 minutes
- Manual sync operations
- Connectivity-based sync when coming online
- Batch processing of queued events

### 3. Race Conditions
- Multiple sync operations could run simultaneously
- Local `isSynced` flag wasn't updated immediately after API success
- No coordination between different sync mechanisms

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Event Deduplication in SheetsService

**Added `_findEventRow` helper method:**
```dart
Future<int> _findEventRow(String eventId) async {
  // Searches Google Sheets for existing event by ID
  // Returns row index if found, -1 if not found
}
```

**Modified `syncGameEvent` method:**
- Now checks if event already exists before syncing
- Updates existing row instead of creating duplicate
- Uses PUT operation for updates, POST for new events

**Modified `_syncGameEventWithRetry` method:**
- Added same deduplication logic to background sync operations
- Ensures all sync paths use consistent deduplication

### 2. Race Condition Prevention in BackgroundSyncService

**Added sync locks:**
```dart
final Set<String> _syncingEventIds = <String>{};
final Set<String> _syncingRosterIds = <String>{};
```

**Enhanced sync methods:**
- Check if event is already being synced before starting
- Add event ID to sync lock during operation
- Remove from sync lock when complete (using try/finally)
- Skip sync if event is already in progress

**Added utility methods:**
```dart
bool isEventSyncing(String eventId)
bool isRosterSyncing(String rosterId)
int get currentlySyncingCount
```

### 3. Improved Error Handling and Logging

**Better sync status tracking:**
- Immediate `isSynced` flag updates after successful API calls
- Detailed logging for duplicate detection
- Clear distinction between create vs update operations

**Enhanced error messages:**
- Log when duplicates are detected and prevented
- Track sync operation types (create/update)
- Better visibility into sync coordination

## Technical Implementation Details

### SheetsService Changes

1. **New `_findEventRow` method** - Searches Events sheet column A for matching event IDs
2. **Updated `syncGameEvent`** - Checks for existing events, updates instead of creating duplicates
3. **Updated `_syncGameEventWithRetry`** - Same deduplication logic for background operations
4. **Improved logging** - Clear messages about create vs update operations

### BackgroundSyncService Changes

1. **Sync locks** - Prevent concurrent syncing of same events
2. **Race condition protection** - Check locks before starting sync operations
3. **Proper cleanup** - Always remove locks in finally blocks
4. **Status tracking** - Monitor currently syncing items

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits
- **No more duplicate events** will be created in Google Sheets
- **Existing events will be updated** instead of duplicated when synced again
- **Race conditions eliminated** through proper sync coordination

### Long-term Improvements
- **Better sync reliability** with improved error handling
- **Reduced API calls** by avoiding unnecessary duplicate operations
- **Cleaner data** in Google Sheets with no duplicate entries

## Backward Compatibility

- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing functionality preserved
- No changes to data models or API contracts
- Existing duplicate events remain (manual cleanup may be needed)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test sync operations** after implementing changes
2. **Verify no new duplicates** are created during multiple sync attempts
3. **Check update functionality** works correctly for existing events
4. **Monitor sync logs** for proper deduplication messages
5. **Test race condition scenarios** with concurrent sync operations

## Future Considerations

### Cleanup of Existing Duplicates
- Consider implementing a cleanup utility to remove existing duplicates
- Could be done by identifying events with same ID and keeping only one
- Should be run as a one-time operation after fix deployment

### Performance Optimization
- The `_findEventRow` method adds an API call for each sync
- Could be optimized by caching event IDs or using batch operations
- Monitor performance impact and optimize if needed

### Additional Safeguards
- Consider adding event versioning for conflict resolution
- Implement sync conflict detection and resolution
- Add data integrity checks during sync operations

## Conclusion

The implemented fixes address the root cause of duplicate events by:
1. **Preventing duplicates** through proper deduplication logic
2. **Eliminating race conditions** with sync coordination
3. **Improving reliability** with better error handling

These changes ensure that the same event will never be synced multiple times to Google Sheets, resolving the duplicate event issue permanently.
