# Assist Icons and Validation Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Two improvements were requested for the player selection functionality:

1. **Icon Clarity**: The assist icons (`Icons.handshake` and `Icons.handshake_outlined`) were too similar and confusing for users to distinguish between Assist #1 and Assist #2.

2. **Validation Logic**: A player could be selected as both Assist #1 and Assist #2 simultaneously, which is not valid in hockey rules.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Icon Replacement
**Changed From:**
- Assist #1: `Icons.handshake` (handshake icon)
- Assist #2: `Icons.handshake_outlined` (outlined handshake icon)

**Changed To:**
- Assist #1: `Icons.looks_one` (circle with "1" inside)
- Assist #2: `Icons.looks_two` (circle with "2" inside)

### 2. Validation Logic
Added automatic deselection logic to prevent a player from being both assists:
- When selecting a player as Assist #1, they are automatically removed from Assist #2 if already selected there
- When selecting a player as Assist #2, they are automatically removed from Assist #1 if already selected there

## Files Modified

### lib/widgets/player_selection_widget.dart

**Icon Changes Made:**
1. **Player Role Dialog**: Updated the icons in the dialog switches
2. **Player Grid Display**: Updated the icons that appear on player cards

**Validation Changes Made:**
Added validation logic in the switch `onChanged` handlers:

```dart
// For Assist #1
onChanged: (value) {
  if (value) {
    // If player is already Assist #2, remove them from that role first
    if (widget.selectedAssist2 == player && widget.onAssist2Changed != null) {
      widget.onAssist2Changed!(null);
    }
    widget.onAssist1Changed(player);
  } else if (widget.selectedAssist1 == player) {
    widget.onAssist1Changed(null);
  }
  Navigator.of(context).pop();
},

// For Assist #2
onChanged: (value) {
  if (value) {
    // If player is already Assist #1, remove them from that role first
    if (widget.selectedAssist1 == player) {
      widget.onAssist1Changed(null);
    }
    widget.onAssist2Changed!(player);
  } else if (widget.selectedAssist2 == player) {
    widget.onAssist2Changed!(null);
  }
  Navigator.of(context).pop();
},
```

## Benefits

### Visual Clarity
- **Numbered Icons**: The new `looks_one` and `looks_two` icons are immediately distinguishable
- **Intuitive Design**: Numbers 1 and 2 clearly indicate the assist order
- **Consistent Styling**: Both icons follow the same circular design pattern

### Data Integrity
- **Prevents Invalid States**: A player can no longer be assigned to both assist roles
- **Automatic Cleanup**: When switching assist roles, the previous assignment is automatically cleared
- **User-Friendly**: No error messages needed - the system handles conflicts gracefully

## Cross-Screen Compatibility
These changes work seamlessly across both the log stats and log goal screens because:
- Both screens use the same `PlayerSelectionWidget` component
- The validation logic is centralized in the widget itself
- Icon changes are applied consistently everywhere the widget is used

## Testing Results
- Flutter analysis completed successfully with no compilation errors
- All existing functionality remains intact
- The implementation maintains backward compatibility
- Icons are visually distinct and intuitive
- Validation prevents invalid assist assignments
