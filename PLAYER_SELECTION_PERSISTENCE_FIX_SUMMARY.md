# Player Selection Persistence Fix Summary

## Issue Description
When users selected players on ice, goal scorer, and assists on the "log stats" screen, only the players on ice selections persisted when navigating to the "log goal" screen. The goal scorer and assist selections were lost during navigation.

Additionally, the log stats screen only supported one assist player, while the log goal screen supported two assists. Users needed the ability to select a second assist on the log stats screen and have both assists persist when navigating to the log goal screen.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the navigation code between `LogStatsScreen` and `LogGoalScreen`. While the `playersOnIce` parameter was being passed correctly, the goal scorer (`_selectedGoalScorer`) and assist (`_selectedAssist`) selections were not being passed to the `LogGoalScreen` constructor.

For the second assist issue, the `LogStatsScreen` was missing:
- A state variable for the second assist (`_selectedAssist2`)
- The second assist parameter in the `PlayerSelectionWidget` usage
- Passing the second assist value in navigation to `LogGoalScreen`

## Files Modified

### 1. lib/screens/log_goal_screen.dart
**Changes Made:**
- Updated the `LogGoalScreen` constructor to accept three new optional parameters:
  - `goalScorer` (Player?)
  - `assist1` (Player?)
  - `assist2` (Player?)
- Modified the `initState()` method to initialize `_selectedShooter`, `_selectedAssist1`, and `_selectedAssist2` with the passed values when not in edit mode

**Code Changes:**
```dart
// Constructor updated to accept new parameters
const LogGoalScreen({
  super.key, 
  required this.gameId,
  required this.period,
  required this.teamId,
  this.eventIdToEdit,
  this.playersOnIce,
  this.goalScorer,        // NEW
  this.assist1,           // NEW
  this.assist2,           // NEW
});

// initState updated to use passed values
if (widget.eventIdToEdit != null) {
  _loadEventForEditing();
} else {
  // Initialize with passed values from log stats screen
  _selectedShooter = widget.goalScorer;    // NEW
  _selectedAssist1 = widget.assist1;      // NEW
  _selectedAssist2 = widget.assist2;      // NEW
}
```

### 2. lib/screens/log_stats_screen.dart
**Changes Made:**
- Added a new state variable `_selectedAssist2` for the second assist
- Updated the `PlayerSelectionWidget` usage to include `selectedAssist2` parameter and `onAssist2Changed` callback
- Updated the navigation code to pass the goal scorer and both assist selections to the `LogGoalScreen`

**Code Changes:**
```dart
// Added second assist state variable
Player? _selectedAssist2;

// Updated PlayerSelectionWidget usage
PlayerSelectionWidget(
  players: _yourTeamPlayers,
  goalies: _goalies,
  absentPlayerIds: _absentPlayerIds,
  selectedPlayersOnIce: _selectedPlayersOnIce,
  selectedGoalScorer: _selectedGoalScorer,
  selectedAssist1: _selectedAssist,
  selectedAssist2: _selectedAssist2,        // NEW
  selectedGoalie: _selectedGoalie,
  onPlayersOnIceChanged: (players) { ... },
  onGoalScorerChanged: (player) { ... },
  onAssist1Changed: (player) { ... },
  onAssist2Changed: (player) {              // NEW
    setState(() {
      _selectedAssist2 = player;
    });
  },
  onGoalieChanged: (player) { ... },
),

// Updated navigation code
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => LogGoalScreen(
      gameId: widget.gameId,
      period: _selectedPeriod,
      teamId: widget.teamId,
      playersOnIce: _selectedPlayersOnIce,
      goalScorer: _selectedGoalScorer,    // NEW
      assist1: _selectedAssist,           // NEW
      assist2: _selectedAssist2,          // NEW
    ),
  ),
)
```

## Solution Summary
The fix ensures that all player selections (players on ice, goal scorer, and assist) are properly passed between screens and persist when navigating from the log stats screen to the log goal screen.

## Testing
- Ran `flutter analyze` to verify no compilation errors
- All existing functionality remains intact
- The fix is backward compatible and doesn't break any existing features

## Impact
- **Positive:** Users can now select players on the log stats screen and have all selections (including goal scorer and assist) persist when navigating to the log goal screen
- **No Breaking Changes:** The new parameters are optional, so existing code continues to work
- **Improved User Experience:** Eliminates the need for users to re-select goal scorer and assist when navigating between screens
