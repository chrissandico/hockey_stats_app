# Delete Functionality Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The delete function when editing shots or penalties was only deleting entries from the local Hive database but not from Google Sheets. This caused deleted events to reappear when the app synced data from Google Sheets.

## Root Cause
The `_deleteEvent` method in `edit_shot_list_screen.dart` only called `event.delete()` which removes the event from the local database, but did not include any logic to delete the corresponding row from Google Sheets.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `deleteEventFromSheet` method to SheetsService
- **Location**: `lib/services/sheets_service.dart`
- **Functionality**: 
  - Finds the row containing the event ID in the Events sheet
  - Uses Google Sheets batchUpdate API to delete the specific row
  - Includes proper authentication and error handling
  - Returns `true` if deletion was successful, `false` otherwise

### 2. Updated `_deleteEvent` method in EditShotListScreen
- **Location**: `lib/screens/edit_shot_list_screen.dart`
- **Enhanced functionality**:
  - First attempts to delete from Google Sheets (if event was synced)
  - If Google Sheets deletion fails, asks user whether to proceed with local deletion
  - Provides detailed user feedback about the deletion status
  - Handles both synced and unsynced events appropriately

## Technical Details

### Google Sheets Deletion Process
1. Authenticate with Google Sheets API using service account
2. Fetch all event IDs from column A of the Events sheet
3. Find the row index containing the target event ID
4. Use batchUpdate API with `deleteDimension` request to remove the row
5. Handle success/failure responses appropriately

### User Experience Improvements
- Shows loading indicator during deletion process
- Provides specific feedback messages:
  - Success: "Event deleted successfully from both local database and Google Sheets"
  - Partial success: "Event deleted locally (Google Sheets deletion failed)"
  - Error: Detailed error message with troubleshooting context

### Error Handling
- Network connectivity issues
- Authentication failures
- Event not found in Google Sheets
- User cancellation options
- Graceful fallback to local-only deletion when appropriate

## Files Modified
1. `lib/services/sheets_service.dart` - Added `deleteEventFromSheet` method
2. `lib/screens/edit_shot_list_screen.dart` - Enhanced `_deleteEvent` method

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test deletion of synced events (should delete from both local and Google Sheets)
2. Test deletion of unsynced events (should delete locally only)
3. Test network failure scenarios (should offer local deletion option)
4. Test authentication failure scenarios
5. Verify events don't reappear after data sync from Google Sheets

## Benefits
- Events are now permanently deleted from both local database and Google Sheets
- No more "zombie" events that reappear after syncing
- Better user feedback and error handling
- Graceful handling of offline/network failure scenarios
- Maintains data consistency between local and remote storage
